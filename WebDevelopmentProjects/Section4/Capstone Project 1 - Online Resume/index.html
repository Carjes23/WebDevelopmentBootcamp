    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>I am a Physics Engineering student and an
        enthusiast of Artificial Intelligence, with technical
        skills in Java and IoT. I am known for quickly
        applying and learning new technologies, always
        with a focus on innovation.</p>

    <h2> Education </h2>

    <h2> Work experience and relevant activities.</h2>
        <p>I have cultivated practical and theoretical
            skills in technology and programming, with
            experience in Java and Android app
            development, integrating sensors, and
            working with IoT and ESP32. I delved into
            digital electronics and microcontroller
            programming with ARM architecture,
            exploring the construction of drivers from
            their foundations and sharing this
            knowledge as a teaching assistant.
            Recently, my passion has shifted towards
            artificial intelligence and machine
            learning, and I have explored cloud
            computing, an area that has also captured
            my interest.
